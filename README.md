The goal of this project was to plot the locations of all UK based smart meters on an interactive map. 
These locations were specified via an API provided by SMS plc, the company which this project was carried out for. 
The map is fully interactive and also includes colour coding based on smart meter uptake percentage in all postcodes across the UK.
